# DSA Practice

This repository contains my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms.  
All solutions are from platforms like LeetCode and some are basic Java practice problems.

## Folder Structure
- `Arrays/` – Problems related to arrays  
- `Strings/` – String-based problems  
- `Sorting/` – Sorting algorithms and related questions  
- `Searching/` – Linear and binary search problems  
- `Hashing/` – HashMap and HashSet problems  

## Basics (Java & OOPS)
This folder contains my Java fundamentals and OOPS practice problems, such as:
- Arrays  
- Methods & Method Overloading  
- Basic mathematical problems  
- Searching & Sorting basics  
- Simple OOPS programs (BankAccount, Employee, etc.)

## Language Used
- Java (Primary)  
- C (Sometimes)  
- Python (Sometimes)

## How I Commit
- I add 1–2 problems daily  
- Every solution has its own file  
- File name = problem name  

## Goal
To improve problem-solving skills and maintain consistency in DSA practice.
